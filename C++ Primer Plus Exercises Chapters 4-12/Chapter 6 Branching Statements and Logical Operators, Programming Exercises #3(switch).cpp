 //  Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.The program should display a menu offering four choices, each labeled with a letter. If the user responds with a letter other than one of the four valid choices, the program should prompt the user to enter a valid response until the user complies.Then the program should use a switch to select a simple action based on the userâ€™s selection.A program run could look something like this:
 Please enter one of the following choices:
 c) carnivore     p) pianis
 t) tree          g) game
